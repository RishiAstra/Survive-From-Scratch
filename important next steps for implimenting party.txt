just don't save party members in the map file
now playerowned are not saved in map, but still saved

[done]remove:
createplayerobject
makeandsetupplayer
setupplayer
ResetPositionOfPlayer


[done]merge playercontrol with npccontrol

to make SetControlledPartyMember and remove setupplayer:
add option for hpbar target to not be automatically assigned
make hpbars for selected character xp etc assigned in setC
set hpbar world invisible etc idk
set up camera
control.cam = camGameObject.GetComponentInChildren<Cam>();
myAbilities = newPlayerObject.GetComponent<Abilities>();
bind hotbar



check myAbilities

[done]remove player script

NPCcontrol setdata setupplayer called, check it
deleted PlayerControl, replace it on player prefab

				for(int i = 0; i < myParty.lastUsed; i++)
				{
					if(myParty.members[i].g != null)
					{
						SetControlledPartyMember(i);
						break;
					}
				}


make default weapon collider for each character, otherwise golem etc are pitiful

consider allowing character to revive slightly on teleport

make dead players just not spawn when teleporting
rin has negative skill points lol fix this, it's due to purple magic requiring skill points

player hp bar/title is always shown for some reason :/ maybe hpbar script not set to autohide

now fix the hp bars
