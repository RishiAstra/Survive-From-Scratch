Certain items, such as an Axe, Stick, or Log, increase your damage when held. These items are classified as weapons.
Other items, such as rocks, can be thrown to deal ranged damage.
Weapons increase your output damage by applying modifiers to your damage.

Modifiers have 4 properties:
pre-add: added to the value of the character
pre-mult: multiplied to the value after pre-add
post-add: added to the value after pre-add and pre-mult
post-mult: multiplied to the value after all the other 

In addition to these 4 properties, Attack Modifiers have another property:
type: the type of attack that the modifier will apply to, e.g. an axe will increase physical damage output but not magic damage output.

If a character has multiple Attack Modifiers applied to them, each property is added before being applied.

Example: The skill strength gives +100% atk pre-mult and the weapon gives +100% atk pre-mult. The character has 10 base attack.
The character's output damage would be (character)10 * [(base)100% + (strength)100% + (weapon)100%] 
= 10 * 300% 
= 30 output damage
