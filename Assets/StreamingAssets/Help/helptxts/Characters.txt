NPCs have enemy traits that they are aggressive towards, such as "monster" or "humanoid". They will attack any other characters with these traits.

All characters (including your player) cannot harm anything that does not have one of these traits.

Examples:
The player cannot damage Rin (the girl) because the player is not unfriendly to any of Rin's traits.
Rin's AOE attack won't damage the player
Spiders won't attack slimes
