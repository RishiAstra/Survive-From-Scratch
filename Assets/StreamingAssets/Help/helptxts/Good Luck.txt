An axe deals more damage than your fists. You can get the materials for an axe by killing slimes, spiders, and golems, but you might find it easier to break trees and find rocks lying around rather than fighting spiders and golems.
Alternatively, you can sell materials to Fred and the Bartender in the village for money and buy an axe from Fred.

Once you have an axe, you can chop down trees fast and craft plenty of buildings.

For testing purposes, you can press alt+right arrow to gain XP or alt+up arrow to gain money

Robert offers a quest when you talk to him and choose certain options

There is a tower in the village near the spawn. It is surrounded by 4 ancient-style pillars. This tower has mutiple levels with many enemies to fight.

Good Luck!
