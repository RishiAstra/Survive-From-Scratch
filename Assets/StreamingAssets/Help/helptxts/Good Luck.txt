Trees are resistant to blunt attacks such as fists, rocks, and sticks. An axe has more damage and isn't a blunt attack. You can get the materials for an axe by killing slimes, spiders, and golems, but you might find it easier to break trees and find rocks lying around rather than fighting spiders and golems.

Once you have an axe, you can chop down trees fast and craft plenty of buildings.

Good Luck!
