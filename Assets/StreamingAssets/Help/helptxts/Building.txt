You can build structures by placing certain items. Log platforms and Log ramps can be placed.

To place a building item, select it in the inventory. A "ghost" of the building will appear. Look at the location that you want the building to be placed such that the ghost is in the desired location.

You can rotate the building by pressing "R". The building can be rotated around different axes, x, y, or z. To change the axis of rotation, press "T".

When the ghost is in the desired location and rotation, click to place it.
